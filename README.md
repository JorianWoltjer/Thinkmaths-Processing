 My solution to [the puzzle from think-maths](https://www.think-maths.co.uk/card-puzzle)

 While playing around with the puzzle, I found that an easy solution is going through a visual binary tree, like this:
 ![Binary tree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26067369/79452269-2c43c300-7fe8-11ea-96b5-2e58aa91c6ae.png)
 The black numbers represent the move, and the red numbers the order of moves. You can see that this is just the depth, and order from left to right of the binary tree. This is also what I implemented in this project.

 Since this is an actual algorithm, you can even change the number of cards, and it will still work.
